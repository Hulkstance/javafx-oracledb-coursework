# JavaFX - OracleDB Coursework
Simple JavaFX application using Oracle Object-Relational Database which has CRUD capabilities and a few queries.

# Features:
- Responsive UI

# TODO:
- The application connects directly to the database which is a bad practice. It should either use Client/Server or Web API.
